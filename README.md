# PROJECT: A market segmentation analysis and perk assignment for TravelTide App platform

## Overview
TravelTide is an online travel industry player that has experienced steady growth since its establishment at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Customer feedback has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space.
Following the startup playbook, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building a hyper advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, creating the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. 
Realising this TravelTide has a new objective to enhance user engagement, retention, and growth by implementing a targeted reward program. Our analysis focuses on identifying and segmenting active users to tailored perks that meet their needs and preferences. 
Below is the current activity on our platform: 
o	User Base: 1.6 million users
o	Sessions: 5.4 million sessions on our page
o	User Activity: Includes both active users and potential visitors, flight and hotel bookings
Using commendation from the Marketing department as a cohort selection criteria, time frame after 2023-01-04 and customers with more than 7 sessions on our platform is used. 

## Objective
The  goal of this proct is to increase active user engagement and visibility through targeted rewards. We want clients to undertake more transactions from our page.
