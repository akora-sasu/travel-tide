## A. Overview
TravelTide is an online travel industry player that has experienced steady growth since its establishment at the tail end of the COVID-19 pandemic (2021-04) on the strength of its data aggregation and search technology, which is best in class. Customer feedback has shown - and industry analysts agree - that TravelTide customers have access to the largest travel inventory in the e-booking space.
Following the startup playbook, TravelTide has maintained a hyper-focus on building a hyper advantage along a limited number of dimensions - in this case, creating the biggest travel inventory and making it easily searchable. Because of this narrow focus, certain aspects of the TravelTide customer experience are underdeveloped, resulting in poor customer retention. 
Realising this TravelTide has a new objective to enhance user engagement, retention, and growth by implementing a targeted reward program. Our analysis focuses on identifying and segmenting active users to tailored perks that meet their needs and preferences. 
Below is the current activity on our platform: 
o	User Base: 1.6 million users
o	Sessions: 5.4 million sessions on our page
o	User Activity: Includes both active users and potential visitors, flight and hotel bookings
Using commendation from the Marketing department as a cohort selection criteria, time frame after 2023-01-04 and customers with more than 7 sessions on our platform are used. 

## B. Objective
This project aims to increase active user engagement and visibility through targeted rewards. We want clients to undertake more transactions from our page.  
## C. Tools
The analysis involved data exploration (EDA), segmentation and visualisations. Below are tools used in differing deployments.
### 1.	PostgreSQL
o	Data manipulation and database generation (feature engineering and segmentation)
### 2.	Python in Colab
o	EDAs and understanding of database
3.	Tableau 
o	Final visualisations (maps, box plots, bar and histogram plots)

Using a decision tree, we segmented users into eight distinct groups based on session behaviour, trip behaviour, and customer demographics:
1.	Backpackers: Young, light travellers who book close to departure. Benefit from adventure discount packages.
2.	Business Travelers: Travel light, prefer convenience. Benefit from free hotel meals.
3.	Couples without Children: Enjoy spontaneous trips. Benefit from spa discounts.
4.	Couples with Children: Travel with more luggage, need convenience. Benefit from free checked bags.
5.	Single Parents: Travel with children, value child-friendly facilities. Benefit from discounts on child-friendly services.
6.	Senior Travelers: Plan ahead of time and enjoy cultural experiences. Benefit from cultural tour discounts.
7.	Potential Clients: Frequent site visitors yet to make a booking. Benefit from welcome discounts.
8.	Visitors: Casual site visitors are attracted by discount codes from sponsors.
